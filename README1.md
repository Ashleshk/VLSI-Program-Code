# VLSI-Program-Code
The ISE Design Suite: Embedded Edition includes Xilinx Platform Studio (XPS), Software Development Kit (SDK), large repository of plug and play IP including MicroBlazeâ„¢ Soft Processor and peripherals, and a complete RTL to bit stream design flow. Embedded Edition provides the fundamental tools, technologies and familiar design flow to achieve optimal design results. These include intelligent clock gating for dynamic power reduction, team design for multi-site design teams, design preservation for timing repeatability, and a partial reconfiguration option for greater system flexibility, size, power, and cost reduction.
